# Knowledge Extraction and Knowledge Fusion Low-cost Military KBQA

**Belong to a SEU Course Project in The Course - "Special Topics in Knowledge Engineering", Instructed by Prof. WU Tianxing ([https://tianxing-wu.github.io/]) and Prof. WANG Meng ([http://wangmengsd.com/])**

I responsible for the iteration of technical solutions, knowledge extraction and integration. (Cooperate with LI Kaixin)

Knowledge extraction: Participated in writing efficient regular expressions. Proposed an innovative approach to extract extremely diverse temporal property by introducing a tagging task model, extracting the first verb after the temporal noun as the property of the temporal entity.

Knowledge Fusion: Summarize "Five Common Trigger Words" to efficiently fuse high-occurring property, and defining "Non-empty Rate" for quantitative analysis to remove low-quality property, which can efficiently merge more than 3000 types of property into 18 high-quality property.

With solid and unique project results and excellent academic representation, the team achieved the first place in the defense among 15 project groups.
